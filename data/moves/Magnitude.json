The damage calculation is: (dice from the d100 table x multiplier by level) + MOVE modifier\n\n| d100       | Dice     |\n| 01-05     | 1d4       |\n| 06-15     | 1d8       |\n| 16-35     | 1d10    |\n| 36-65     | 1d12    |\n| 66-85     | 2d6       |\n| 86-95     | 2d8       |\n|  96-100 | 2d12    |\n\nMultiplier by level:\nFrom level 1 to 4: 1x\nFrom level 5 to 9: 2x\nFrom level 10 to 16: 3x\nFrom level 17 to 20: 4x",
